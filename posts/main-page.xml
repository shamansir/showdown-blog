By default, main page is `index.html`. You can rename it freely, just don't forget to change `link` property in `prefs.xml` correspondingly.

The problem is that you need to specify its path in blog URL, you can't omit it by default.

But if you are handy with `.htaccess` `DirectoryIndex` and/or `mod_rewrite`, you can solve this problem easily.
