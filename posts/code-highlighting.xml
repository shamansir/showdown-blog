If you write a programming blog, you might want to highlight your code. To do this, just set `highlight-code` in `prefs.xml` to `true`.

> Be aware, currently highlighting is turned on only for single posts (not for main page). When the main page will support posts summary, I will may be turn it back.

So just add `#!<lang-id>` code as first line of your code block. Examples are: `#!xml`, `#!java`, `#!javascript`. And look, your code highlighting works!

    #!java
    public class MySuperCode {
   
        private final String initialVar;
       
        public MySuperCode(String initialVar) {
            this.initialVar = initialVar;
        }
       
    }

[SHJS](http://shjs.sourceforge.net/) engine is used to make it work. If you need any programming language support that is not in the showdown-blog archive, just download its `.js`-file and put it to `js/sh_lang/<lang-id>.min.js`. Also, to change code highlighting style, just download its `.css` file and change the corresponding line in `index.html` file to the new style.
